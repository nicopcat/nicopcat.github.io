We meet each other after work on Friday. Go to downtown and walk around on the streer aimlessly.</p><p>We decide to eat sushi to celebrate this rather long vacation at ShiWu Japanese Restraunt. It&#39;s our usual sushi place. We oder same old food as we used to. Such a content meal.</p><p>After that, we decide to visit Mimi and stay for one night at her place. Before departing, we order 3 Luckin take out coffee. One for her.</p><p>Me and Jane spent a nice night together.</p><p>During the day, we just chill at home. Order delivery food (Longjiang Pork Rice Bowl \u2B50\u2B50\u2B50 Lack of juice), play Hearthstone.</p><p>After shower, Jane uses hair drier to help my hair dry up. She&#39;s very gentle and careful. I&#39;ve booked her to do my makeup and massage for the rest of the time. \u{1F609}</p><p>We go home seperately later.</p><h1 id="day-2-wedding-day" tabindex="-1">Day 2 - Wedding Day <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2-wedding-day" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1><p>I wake up at 9:30, playing a couple of Hearthstone Battlegrounds. Jane come to my place at 2:30 and we go to Lotus Venue together.</p><p>It&#39;s nice, sunny and hot afternoon. We arrive earlier than other. And I just happen to see my classmates sitting not very far from us.</p><p>We go to them and say hi. All of us take the mini tour bus to arrive the lawn. It&#39;s scorching hot. Everyone&#39;s sweating. I see our bride and bridegroom in their best shape and suits, shooting photogrphy. We chat and laugh, watching them move here and there.</p><p>The ceremony set is well design. I love the green theme, green soda water, brocoli, green bananas and some other plants. The whole venue looks young and elegant.</p><p>About 10 minutes later, we sit in the bright sun. They tell us to grab some soda water but those have been exposed to the sun long before we arrived. Not very tempting to drink.</p><p>Anyway, we sit under the small shadow, waiting for the begging of the ceremony.</p><p>It&#39;s was lovely and sweet to see Maomao and Xiaoyu walking towards each other, looking into each other&#39;s eyes, saying something sweet.</p><p>I love those letters they read to the partner and us. We become their witness of love and life.</p><p>During the lettering reading session, me and Jane almost held back our tears. Because the speech is very sweet and sincere. I feel really happy for them.</p><p>While listening the speech, I also think about us. Our sweet moments, querrals, dreams, future home and many other things.</p><p>After the last activies, so many photographing, we left the lawn venue, also taking the mini bus back. Sitting in the hall and wait for the evening dinner to start.</p><p>The dinner begins at 7pm ish. We were arranged at the further table to the stage. Not much left for the old classmates to chat, they just look down on the phone. I talk to Jane constantly about anything, this and that, poeple lovely or weird. Time passes by soon.</p><p>Finally, dishes served.</p><p>We sit with bridegroom&#39;s friends. So we didn&#39;t talk at all. No one cares to chat or know what to chat. Me and Jane just figure which dish are good and how to grab them lol.</p><p>Around 9, we took pictures again for the classmates from 0919. What a memory huh.</p><p>Then we left. We went to K to spend some time.</p><h1 id="day-3-help-out" tabindex="-1">Day 3 - Help Out <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3-help-out" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1><p>Today&#39;s mission is to help out Jane at her Kaoqiao bussiness. Basicly, I just need to help her to get familiar with driving and be with her. Before going back, collect all the Kaoqiao sets back to her company.</p><p>I stay home until 5 o&#39;clock. Jane pick me up to her company. I drive out of the garage and we switch seats.</p><p>She was very nevours at first, but she&#39;s getting better and better. We arrive safely!</p><p>There are 2 of her collegue from other dept (Micca) selling coffee.</p><p>\uFF08to be continued..)</p>',31),r=[s];function i(h,l,d,p,c,u){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const y=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
